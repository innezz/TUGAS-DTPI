<h1> Catherine, Princess of Wales</h1>

	<p> Euphonic melody escapes out of her lips lovingly, those enchanting sounds reiterated throughout the hallway of an transcendental opulent chateau. Fleur lights slowly flashes on her face, gleams fills her gloomy-yet-peaceful eyes, her dreamlike face makes everyone gave up their attention, how she daintily steps her feet onto the cold tile, those beautiful eyes pierce through and leaves every soul got tounge-tied. Oh, she’s what they entitled as “ethereal”. Furthermore, the ethereal looking quaint or also known as Kate went out. Her long enchanted hand were stuck out, waving gently. Lonesomeness has just been engulfing her, likewise. Hence, in order to put an end over her solitudeness, companionship is the one she seeks for.  She, the light in the dark. Owner of a beautiful smile and spreader of happiness, Catherine Elizabeth Middleton.
